~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Synetic Dawn is required. This mod is achievment compatible 

Step 0: I highly reccomend downloading notepad ++. It's free (forever) and significantly makes editting files easier.

Step 1: Copy and paste the contents of ancestor_advisor_voice_types.txt into the 00_advisor_voice_types.txt at the bottom of the file.
Directory: [C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Stellaris\sound\advisor_voice_types]

Step 2: Copy and past the contents of ancestor_voice.asset into the soundgroups.asset file at the bottom of the file.
Directory: [C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Stellaris\sound}

Step 3: Copy auth_ancestor.dds into the authorities folder.
Directory: [C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Stellaris\gfx\interface\icons\governments\authorities]

Step 4: Copy the ancestor folder into the vo/ethics folder.
Directory: [C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Stellaris\sound\vo\ethics]
