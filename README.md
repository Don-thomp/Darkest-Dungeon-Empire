# Darkest-Dungeon-Empire
Stellaris Darkest Dungeon Adviser mod
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Synetic Dawn is required. This mod is achievment compatible 

Step 0: I highly reccomend downloading notepad ++. It's free (forever) and significantly makes editting files easier.

Step 1: Copy and paste the contents of ancestor_advisor_voice_types.txt into the 00_advisor_voice_types.txt at the bottom of the file.
Directory: [C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Stellaris\sound\advisor_voice_types]

Step 2: Copy and past the contents of ancestor_voice.asset into the soundgroups.asset file at the bottom of the file. Edit it using notepad++.
Directory: [C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Stellaris\sound}

Step 3: Copy auth_ancestor.dds into the authorities folder.
Directory: [C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Stellaris\gfx\interface\icons\governments\authorities]

Step 4: Copy the ancestor folder into the vo/ethics folder.
Directory: [C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Stellaris\sound\vo\ethics]

Step 5 (optional): Included also is a name list. Add it into name_list folder. Then go to localisation folder and edit "l_english.yml" (use notepad++) and add the line " name_list_Darkest:0 Darkest". Remember to include the space before the line. Screenshots should show what's right. It's pretty bare bones but it adds the hero classes as ship classes, some planet names associated with planet biome (e.g. cove related to ocean worlds). THIS IS NOT ACHIEVMENT COMPATIBLE. EDITTING THE NAMELIST AFFECTS THE CHECKSUM
Directory (name_list): [C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Stellaris\common\name_lists]
Directory (l_english.yml): [C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Stellaris\localisation\english]

Step 6 (optional): If you want the flag emblem, take each .dds image of the flag from the included folder and put them in the corresponding folders in the paradox flag folder (i.e. the .dds file from my flag/map goes into the flags/paradox/map folder, flag/small goes into flags/paradox/small and regular goes into just the flags/paradox folder. THIS IS ACHIEVEMENT COMPATIBLE
